Safetyportal
============

This is a single page web app project. I used Hackathon as a base project with which I further built upon.

The primary addons used are Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, and more.


Project Details
===============

This project seeks to implement a web portal that services a prototype manufacturing plant. It seeks to change the functions available to a user based upon which type of user is currently logged in.
